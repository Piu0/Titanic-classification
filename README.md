# Titanic-classification
The Titanic classification model is designed to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. This machine learning model is built using Python and leverages the scikit-learn library for its implementation.

The first step involves loading and preprocessing the Titanic dataset. Missing values in features like age and embarkation point are filled with appropriate values, ensuring that the data is ready for analysis. Categorical variables, such as gender and embarkation point, are encoded into numerical values to facilitate model training.

The core of the model is a Random Forest Classifier, a popular ensemble learning algorithm. It's chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships between features and its resistance to overfitting. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset, known as the training set, which contains both the features (socio-economic status, age, gender, etc.) and the corresponding target variable (survival status).

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate portion of the dataset, the testing set, to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics like accuracy, the confusion matrix, and the classification report are used to gauge how well the model predicts survival outcomes.

This Titanic classification model not only provides insight into the factors that contributed to survival, such as being female, having a higher socio-economic status, or being younger, but it also serves as a practical tool for predicting individual survival probabilities. Such models are valuable for understanding historical events like the Titanic disaster and can be adapted to similar classification problems in various domains, from healthcare to finance.
